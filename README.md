## Data Storage Schema
How we store data

Ex:
- Do we `need` a `<title>` for each `webpage`?
- Do we `need` or `want` a `title` and/or `alt` for every `image`?
- Do we `want` a `user-who-changed-the-variable` for every `changed-variable`?



## Data Gathering Framework
How we collect data

Ex:
- Can we get a domain from an email?
- Can we scrape a website to collect social media URLs?
- Can we get a lat/long coordinated from an address?
- Can we get a range of color schemes from a logo?
- Can we generate an alt tag from a logo via image-object regocnition AI?





## User Interface
### Tasks
#### Task Prioritization Framework

Assuming our `Data Gathering Framework` cannot/does not get valid info for something... how do we show prioritize how the we task for confirmation from the user?

Ex:
- Does a `what-is-the-areaCode-for-this-phoneNumber-variable?` task take priority over `how-often-should-we-post-to-{{this}}-platform` task?
